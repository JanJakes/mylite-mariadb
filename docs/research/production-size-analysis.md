# Production size analysis

This document records the current production-oriented size profile for MyLite
and the measured impact of likely size-reduction levers.

## Measurement scope

The baseline is the current `tools/build-mariadb-minsize.sh` profile:

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`
- `BUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release`
- `FEATURE_SET=small`
- `WITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER=ON`
- `DISABLE_SHARED=ON`
- `WITHOUT_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS=ON`
- system `ssl`, `pcre`, `fmt`, and `zlib`
- `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_ORACLE_PARSER=ON`
- Aria, InnoDB, partitioning, Performance Schema, RocksDB, Mroonga, Connect,
  Spider, S3, OQGraph, Sphinx, ColumnStore, FederatedX, Blackhole, Archive,
  feedback, and selected authentication plugins disabled
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_ARIA=ON`
- `USE_ARIA_FOR_TMP_TABLES=OFF`

The original comparison baseline was generated at `2026-05-12T00:33:29Z` from
`vendor/mariadb/server` into `build/mariadb-minsize`. Current measurements
include the `type-plugin-size-profile`, `charset-small-profile`, and
`oracle-parser-size-profile`, `static-archive-strip-profile`, and
`small-builtin-plugin-profile`, `xml-function-size-profile`, and
`gis-function-size-profile`, `executable-export-size-profile`,
`vector-function-size-profile`, `profiling-size-profile`, and
`help-command-size-profile` attempts, which
remove the built-in `type_geom`, `type_inet`, `type_uuid`, `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, `user_variables`, `userstat`, and `mhnsw` plugins, set
`WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none`, omit the Oracle SQL-mode parser, omit XML, GIS, and
vector SQL functions, disable MariaDB statement profiling, omit the SQL `HELP`
command implementation, remove full-symbol exports from MyLite smoke
executables, and strip the static archive in the MyLite minsize profile.

This project does not yet have a final packaged production artifact such as a
shared `libmylite.so` bundle. For now, the most useful size signals are:

- the static embedded MariaDB archive used by MyLite,
- the first-party MyLite wrapper archive,
- the MyLite engine component archive,
- stripped linked smoke binaries as an estimate of final linked footprint, and
- dynamic system libraries only if a distribution bundle chooses to vendor
  them instead of relying on platform packages.

## Current baseline

| Artifact | Bytes | MiB | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/libmysqld/libmariadbd.a` | 32,513,192 | 31.01 | Main embedded MariaDB archive, 487 objects, stripped |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/mylite/libmylite.a` | 93,752 | 0.09 | First-party public wrapper |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/storage/mylite/libmylite_embedded.a` | 303,480 | 0.29 | MyLite storage-engine component archive |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/mylite/mylite-open-close-smoke` | 15,180,208 | 14.48 | Unstripped linked smoke binary |
| stripped `mylite-open-close-smoke` copy | 12,892,376 | 12.30 | `strip --strip-unneeded` on copied binary |

The linked smoke binary has this section profile:

| Section group | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| text | 10,787,268 |
| data | 2,098,664 |
| bss | 298,040 |
| total `size` decimal | 13,183,972 |

Largest linked sections in the open-close smoke binary:

| Section | Bytes | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `.rela.dyn` | 4,119,840 | Dynamic relocations from the current link shape |
| `.text` | 3,459,004 | Executable code |
| `.rodata` | 2,143,305 | Collation tables, parser tables, SQL metadata, constants |
| `.data.rel.ro` | 1,298,120 | Relocated read-only data |
| `.eh_frame` | 795,428 | Unwind metadata |
| `.data` | 766,040 | Writable data |
| `.bss` | 298,008 | Zero-initialized writable data |
| `.eh_frame_hdr` | 181,260 | Unwind table index |

If a Linux distribution bundle vendors the current dynamic dependencies, it
adds about 11,340,944 bytes, or 10.82 MiB, before compression:

| Dependency | Resolved file size |
| --- | ---: |
| `libpcre2-8.so.0.11.2` | 592,328 |
| `libz.so.1.3` | 133,272 |
| `libssl.so.3` | 737,192 |
| `libcrypto.so.3` | 4,597,928 |
| `libcrypt.so.1.1.0` | 198,584 |
| `libstdc++.so.6.0.33` | 2,633,224 |
| `libm.so.6` | 591,800 |
| `libgcc_s.so.1` | 133,696 |
| `libc.so.6` | 1,722,920 |

These libraries are not currently part of `libmariadbd.a`. They matter only for
distribution formats that bundle runtime libraries.

## Where the bytes are

The SQL layer dominates the current static footprint. The component table below
was captured before the type-plugin, charset-small, Oracle-parser, static
archive strip, and small-plugin size profiles were applied and explains why
those attempts were worth testing.

| Component archive | Bytes | MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `libmysqld/libsql_embedded.a` | 32,826,258 | 31.31 |
| `strings/libstrings.a` | 4,839,668 | 4.62 |
| `plugin/type_inet/libtype_inet_embedded.a` | 2,384,608 | 2.27 |
| `plugin/type_uuid/libtype_uuid_embedded.a` | 1,066,660 | 1.02 |
| `mysys/libmysys.a` | 649,718 | 0.62 |
| `storage/myisam/libmyisam_embedded.a` | 586,252 | 0.56 |
| `storage/mylite/libmylite_embedded.a` | 303,480 | 0.29 |
| `storage/heap/libheap_embedded.a` | 158,668 | 0.15 |
| `storage/myisammrg/libmyisammrg_embedded.a` | 152,748 | 0.15 |
| `storage/csv/libcsv.a` | 112,192 | 0.11 |
| `storage/sequence/libsequence.a` | 99,508 | 0.09 |
| `sql/libsql_sequence_embedded.a` | 95,722 | 0.09 |
| `mylite/libmylite.a` | 93,752 | 0.09 |

The largest individual objects are mostly SQL expression, type, parser,
charset, and optional type support:

| Object | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| `item_func.cc.o` | 1,575,832 |
| `sql_type.cc.o` | 1,456,224 |
| `item_strfunc.cc.o` | 1,440,840 |
| `yy_mariadb.cc.o` | 1,386,632 |
| `yy_oracle.cc.o` | 1,372,688 |
| `item.cc.o` | 1,258,392 |
| `item_create.cc.o` | 1,139,664 |
| `item_timefunc.cc.o` | 1,049,896 |
| `item_cmpfunc.cc.o` | 1,027,216 |
| `ctype-uca1400.c.o` | 973,408 |
| `item_geofunc.cc.o` | 908,920 |
| `field.cc.o` | 858,688 |
| `type_uuid/plugin.cc.o` | 858,584 |
| `type_inet/plugin.cc.o` | 794,384 |
| `type_inet/sql_type_inet.cc.o` | 749,712 |
| `ctype-uca.c.o` | 739,744 |

The current built-in plugins are:

- `binlog`
- `csv`
- `heap`
- `myisam`
- `myisammrg`
- `mylite`
- `mysql_password`
- `online_alter_log`
- `sql_sequence`

## Measured reduction experiments

| Experiment | Archive bytes | Archive delta | Stripped linked smoke | Linked delta | Result |

| Strip archive with `strip --strip-unneeded` | 41,873,048 | -1,532,384 | n/a | n/a | Higher risk than `strip -g` for static archives |
| `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` before UCA fix | 40,820,782 | -2,584,650 | 16,836,664 | -2,495,240 | Segfaulted in open-close smoke |

| `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` | 34,474,690 | 0 from current | 15,849,720 | 0 from current | Reject; current smokes pass but no artifact-size reduction |
| `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections` plus `--gc-sections` | 48,305,352 | +4,899,920 | 19,331,816 | -88 | Reject |
| CMake LTO | 342,480,510 | +299,075,078 | 18,016,192 | -1,315,712 | Reject for now due archive bloat and ODR warnings |

The two original `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` builds both completed and linked,
but `mylite-open-close-smoke --mode=exclusive` exited with signal 139. The
follow-up `charset-small-profile` slice fixed the UCA 1400 startup assumption
by skipping generated collations whose base compiled charset is absent. The
profile now passes current smokes while retaining the compiled default
`utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci`.

Stripping the current linked open-close smoke binary reduces it from
15,180,208 bytes
to 12,892,376 bytes, saving 2,287,832 bytes, or 2.18 MiB. That remains the
lowest-risk packaging win for any copied executable or shared-library style
artifact.

The LTO build reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by 1.25 MiB, but the
static archive became 326.61 MiB and GCC emitted type/ODR mismatch warnings
around MariaDB parser and server structures, including generated parser types.
That is not a safe release lever today.

The earlier plugin flags experiment did remove small built-ins such as `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, and `user_variables`, but `type_geom`, `type_inet`,
`type_uuid`, and `userstat` remained built in. The later type-plugin and
small-plugin profiles supersede that partial result.

The `type-plugin-size-profile` attempt then made `type_geom`, `type_inet`, and
`type_uuid` non-mandatory and disabled them in the MyLite minsize profile. That
reduced the static archive by 3,463,834 bytes and the stripped linked smoke by
396,104 bytes while current MyLite smokes still passed.

The `charset-small-profile` attempt then set `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` and
fixed UCA 1400 registration for omitted base charsets. On top of the type
plugin profile, it reduced the static archive by another 2,584,666 bytes and
the stripped linked smoke binary by another 2,495,240 bytes while current MyLite
smokes still passed.

The `oracle-parser-size-profile` attempt then removed `yy_oracle.cc.o` from the
embedded archive and linked a 1,664-byte unsupported-mode stub instead. On top
of the charset-small profile, it reduced the static archive by another
1,412,822 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 589,824 bytes
while current MyLite smokes still passed. The open/close smoke now verifies
that a statement parsed after `SET sql_mode=ORACLE` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

The `static-archive-strip-profile` attempt then ran `strip --strip-unneeded`
and `ranlib` on `libmariadbd.a` after building the `mysqlserver` target. On top
of the Oracle-parser profile, it reduced the static archive by another
1,337,440 bytes. The stripped linked smoke binary was unchanged, but relinking
current smokes against the stripped archive passed.

The `small-builtin-plugin-profile` attempt then disabled optional `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, `user_variables`, and `userstat` built-ins while leaving
mandatory `sql_sequence` support intact. On top of the static archive strip, it
reduced the static archive by another 131,980 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke binary by another 1,016 bytes.

The `xml-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_xmlfunc.cc` from the
embedded source list and removed the `EXTRACTVALUE` and `UPDATEXML` native
function builders in the minsize profile. On top of the small built-in plugin
profile, it reduced the static archive by another 517,000 bytes and the
stripped linked smoke binary by another 264,240 bytes. The linked open-close
smoke binary no longer contains `Item_func_xml_extractvalue`,
`Item_func_xml_update`, or `my_xpath_function` symbols, and the open/close
smoke verifies both XML functions now fail through MariaDB's unknown-function
path.

The `gis-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_geofunc.cc`,
`gcalc_tools.cc`, and `gcalc_slicescan.cc` from the embedded source list and
linked a small empty GIS registry/type-constructor shim instead. On top of the
XML function profile, it reduced the static archive by another 864,782 bytes
and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 463,440 bytes. The linked
open-close smoke binary no longer contains `Item_func_geometry_from_text`,
`Create_func_geometry_from_text`, or `Gcalc_function` symbols, and the
open/close smoke verifies `ST_ASTEXT()` now fails through MariaDB's
unknown-function path. The compatibility harness still verifies MyLite rejects
GEOMETRY columns and SPATIAL keys.

The `executable-export-size-profile` attempt then removed `ENABLE_EXPORTS TRUE`
from MyLite-owned smoke executables. On top of the GIS function profile, it left
the static archive unchanged and reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by
another 2,162,688 bytes. The dynamic symbol count in
`mylite-open-close-smoke` dropped from 28,646 to 488, and the link command no
longer includes `-Wl,--export-dynamic`. This is a linked-artifact size win, not
a static archive reduction.

The `vector-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_vectorfunc.cc`
and `vector_mhnsw.cc` from the embedded source list, guarded vector native
function builders, removed the mandatory `mhnsw` built-in plugin reference in
the vector-disabled profile, and linked a small MHNSW unsupported-symbol stub.
On top of the executable-export profile, it reduced the static archive by
another 230,182 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 1,152
bytes. The archive no longer defines `builtin_maria_mhnsw_plugin`,
`Item_func_vec_*`, `Create_func_vec_*`, `FVectorNode`, or `MHNSW_Share`
symbols, and the open/close smoke verifies `VEC_FROMTEXT()` and
`VEC_DISTANCE()` fail through MariaDB's unknown-function path.

The `profiling-size-profile` attempt then set `ENABLED_PROFILING=OFF` in the
minsize CMake profile and added a `SHOW PROFILES` disabled-feature smoke check.
On top of the vector-function profile, it reduced the static archive by another
166,334 bytes and left the stripped linked smoke binary unchanged. The archive
no longer defines the full `PROFILING`, `QUERY_PROFILE`, or
`PROF_MEASUREMENT` classes, while retaining small disabled-feature entry points
for MariaDB's existing SQL and information-schema wiring.

The `help-command-size-profile` attempt then removed `sql_help.cc` from the
embedded source list and linked a small unsupported-command shim for
`mysqld_help()` and `mysqld_help_prepare()`. On top of the profiling profile,
it reduced the static archive by another 183,200 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke binary by another 65,824 bytes. The archive now contains
`mylite_help_command_stub.cc.o` instead of the full help-table implementation,
and the open/close smoke verifies `HELP 'contents'` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

## Decision matrix

| Lever | Expected savings | Risk | Worth doing? | Reason |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Strip copied release binaries | About 2.30 MiB on the current linked smoke binary | Low | Yes | Standard packaging step; does not change source behavior |
| Strip release static archive with `strip --strip-unneeded` | 1.28 MiB beyond Oracle-parser profile | Medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes relink and pass; downstream static consumers may still need coverage |
| Strip release static archive with `strip -g` | About 0.95 MiB on the current archive | Low | Fallback | Less aggressive alternative if `--strip-unneeded` breaks a consumer |
| `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=complex` | About 0.08 MiB | Low | No | Savings are too small to justify a compatibility profile |
| `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` / `charset-small-profile` | 2.46 MiB archive and 2.38 MiB stripped linked beyond type-plugin profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass after the UCA 1400 null-base fix, but non-default charsets are omitted |
| Make type plugins profile-gated | 3.30 MiB archive, 0.38 MiB stripped linked | Medium/high | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `INET`, `UUID`, and spatial plugin surfaces are compatibility tradeoffs |
| Remove small optional built-ins | 0.13 MiB archive, 0.001 MiB stripped linked | Medium/low | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but plugin-provided information-schema surfaces are omitted |
| Remove or profile-gate Oracle SQL parser | 1.35 MiB archive and 0.56 MiB stripped linked beyond charset-small profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `sql_mode=ORACLE` now fails explicitly in the minsize profile |
| Remove XML SQL functions | 0.49 MiB archive and 0.25 MiB stripped linked beyond small-builtin profile | Medium compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `EXTRACTVALUE()` and `UPDATEXML()` now fail as unknown functions |
| Remove GIS SQL functions | 0.82 MiB archive and 0.44 MiB stripped linked beyond XML profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but native GIS functions now fail as unknown functions in the minsize profile |
| Remove unnecessary executable symbol exports | 0 archive, 2.06 MiB stripped linked beyond GIS profile | Low/medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; this only applies to linked executables that are not dynamic-plugin hosts |
| Remove vector SQL functions and MHNSW | 0.22 MiB archive, negligible stripped linked beyond executable-export profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but vector functions and MHNSW vector indexes are omitted from the minsize profile |
| Disable statement profiling | 0.16 MiB archive, no stripped linked change beyond vector-function profile | Low/medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; `SHOW PROFILE(S)` now report MariaDB's disabled-feature diagnostic |
| Remove SQL `HELP` command implementation | 0.17 MiB archive, 0.06 MiB stripped linked beyond profiling profile | Low/medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; `HELP` now reports a stable unsupported-command diagnostic |
| Remove server-only SQL subsystems | Potentially large | High | Research later | The big bytes are entangled in `libsql_embedded.a`; needs slice-by-slice fork work |
| `DISABLE_PSI_*` switches | 0 in this build | Low | No | No measured effect |
| `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` | 0 in this build | Low | No | Full rebuild produced identical archive and stripped linked sizes |
| section garbage collection | 0 useful savings, archive grows | Low | No | Worsens archive size and does not improve stripped linked size |
| LTO | About 1.25 MiB linked, archive much larger | High | No | ODR warnings and huge archives are unacceptable for release |
| Bundle fewer dynamic libraries | Up to 10.82 MiB if currently vendored | Distribution-dependent | Decide per packaging target | Current static archive does not include these libraries |

## Recommendations

Take these now:

1. Add an explicit release-packaging strip step for copied artifacts.
2. Keep `strip --strip-unneeded` for the minsize static archive while current
   consumer-link smokes pass.
3. Keep a stripped linked smoke binary size in the build report so regressions
   are visible.

Do not take these now:

1. Do not enable LTO for production. The linked binary gets smaller, but the
   archive becomes much larger and the compiler reports ODR-sensitive MariaDB
   type mismatches.
2. Do not spend time on `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=complex`, PSI switches, or section
   garbage collection as standalone size work.

Research next if size becomes a release blocker:

1. Longer-term SQL-layer pruning of server-only surfaces. This is likely where
   meaningful multi-MiB savings exist, but it should be done as compatibility
   slices, not as broad dead-code removal.

The best next decisions are deeper SQL-layer reductions as deliberate
compatibility work. The current data does not support broad compiler/linker
tuning as an effective path.
