# Production size analysis

This document records the current production-oriented size profile for MyLite
and the measured impact of likely size-reduction levers.

## Measurement scope

The baseline is the current `tools/build-mariadb-minsize.sh` profile:

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`
- `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr -Wl,--gc-sections`
- `CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr -Wl,--gc-sections`
- `CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr -Wl,--gc-sections`
- `BUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release`
- `FEATURE_SET=small`
- `WITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER=ON`
- `DISABLE_SHARED=ON`
- `WITHOUT_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS=ON`
- system `ssl`, `pcre`, `fmt`, and `zlib`
- `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_ORACLE_PARSER=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_JSON_SCHEMA_VALID=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_QUERY_CACHE=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_LEGACY_STORAGE_ENGINES=ON`
- Aria, InnoDB, partitioning, Performance Schema, RocksDB, Mroonga, Connect,
  Spider, S3, OQGraph, Sphinx, ColumnStore, FederatedX, Blackhole, Archive,
  feedback, and selected authentication plugins disabled
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_ARIA=ON`
- `MYLITE_ENABLE_SECTION_GC=ON`
- `USE_ARIA_FOR_TMP_TABLES=OFF`

The original comparison baseline was generated at `2026-05-12T00:33:29Z` from
`vendor/mariadb/server` into `build/mariadb-minsize`. Current measurements
include the `type-plugin-size-profile`, `charset-small-profile`, and
`oracle-parser-size-profile`, `static-archive-strip-profile`, and
`small-builtin-plugin-profile`, `xml-function-size-profile`, and
`gis-function-size-profile`, `executable-export-size-profile`,
`vector-function-size-profile`, `profiling-size-profile`, and
`help-command-size-profile`, `procedure-analyse-size-profile`, and
`relr-linker-size-profile`, `legacy-storage-engine-size-profile`,
`section-gc-size-profile`, `json-schema-valid-size-profile`, and
`query-cache-size-profile` attempts, which
remove the built-in `type_geom`, `type_inet`, `type_uuid`, `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, `user_variables`, `userstat`, `mhnsw`, `csv`, and
`myisammrg` plugins, set
`WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none`, omit the Oracle SQL-mode parser, omit XML, GIS, and
vector SQL functions, disable MariaDB statement profiling, omit the SQL `HELP`
command implementation, omit the `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` implementation, remove
full-symbol exports from MyLite smoke executables, link runtime-style artifacts
with lld and compact `DT_RELR` relative relocations, make the inherited MyISAM
engine non-user-selectable while retaining it for internal disk temporary
tables, compile minsize objects into per-function/per-data sections and link
runtime-style artifacts with `--gc-sections`, omit the `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()`
validator while retaining ordinary JSON functions, omit MariaDB's query cache
while reporting `have_query_cache=NO`, and strip the static archive in the
MyLite minsize profile.

This project does not yet have a final packaged production artifact such as a
shared `libmylite.so` bundle. For now, the most useful size signals are:

- the static embedded MariaDB archive used by MyLite,
- the first-party MyLite wrapper archive,
- the MyLite engine component archive,
- stripped linked smoke binaries as an estimate of final linked footprint, and
- dynamic system libraries only if a distribution bundle chooses to vendor
  them instead of relying on platform packages.

## Current baseline

The current values were measured from a clean
`MYLITE_MARIADB_BUILD_DIR=build/mariadb-minsize-query-cache` run. Paths below
use the default build directory names for readability.

| Artifact | Bytes | MiB | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/libmysqld/libmariadbd.a` | 36,101,680 | 34.43 | Main embedded MariaDB archive, 460 objects, stripped; section metadata grows the archive |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/mylite/libmylite.a` | 122,792 | 0.12 | First-party public wrapper |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/storage/mylite/libmylite_embedded.a` | 388,440 | 0.37 | MyLite storage-engine component archive |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/mylite/mylite-open-close-smoke` | 10,950,672 | 10.44 | Unstripped linked smoke binary, lld RELR and section GC |
| stripped `mylite-open-close-smoke` copy | 8,390,256 | 8.00 | `strip --strip-unneeded` on copied binary |

The linked smoke binary has this section profile:

| Section group | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| text | 6,421,288 |
| data | 1,965,600 |
| bss | 300,209 |
| total `size` decimal | 8,687,097 |

Largest linked sections in the open-close smoke binary:

| Section | Bytes | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `.text` | 3,215,132 | Executable code |
| `.rodata` | 2,143,827 | Collation tables, parser tables, SQL metadata, constants |
| `.data.rel.ro` | 1,172,176 | Relocated read-only data |
| `.data` | 760,216 | Writable data |
| `.eh_frame` | 735,116 | Unwind metadata |
| `.bss` | 296,857 | Zero-initialized writable data |
| `.eh_frame_hdr` | 167,580 | Unwind table index |
| `.rela.dyn` | 52,512 | Remaining unpacked dynamic relocations |
| `.relr.dyn` | 22,232 | Packed relative relocations |

If a Linux distribution bundle vendors the current dynamic dependencies, it
adds about 11,340,944 bytes, or 10.82 MiB, before compression:

| Dependency | Resolved file size |
| --- | ---: |
| `libpcre2-8.so.0.11.2` | 592,328 |
| `libz.so.1.3` | 133,272 |
| `libssl.so.3` | 737,192 |
| `libcrypto.so.3` | 4,597,928 |
| `libcrypt.so.1.1.0` | 198,584 |
| `libstdc++.so.6.0.33` | 2,633,224 |
| `libm.so.6` | 591,800 |
| `libgcc_s.so.1` | 133,696 |
| `libc.so.6` | 1,722,920 |

These libraries are not currently part of `libmariadbd.a`. They matter only for
distribution formats that bundle runtime libraries.

## Where the bytes are

The SQL layer dominates the current static footprint. The component table below
was captured before the type-plugin, charset-small, Oracle-parser, static
archive strip, and small-plugin size profiles were applied and explains why
those attempts were worth testing.

| Component archive | Bytes | MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `libmysqld/libsql_embedded.a` | 32,826,258 | 31.31 |
| `strings/libstrings.a` | 4,839,668 | 4.62 |
| `plugin/type_inet/libtype_inet_embedded.a` | 2,384,608 | 2.27 |
| `plugin/type_uuid/libtype_uuid_embedded.a` | 1,066,660 | 1.02 |
| `mysys/libmysys.a` | 649,718 | 0.62 |
| `storage/myisam/libmyisam_embedded.a` | 586,252 | 0.56 |
| `storage/mylite/libmylite_embedded.a` | 303,480 | 0.29 |
| `storage/heap/libheap_embedded.a` | 158,668 | 0.15 |
| `storage/myisammrg/libmyisammrg_embedded.a` | 152,748 | 0.15 |
| `storage/csv/libcsv.a` | 112,192 | 0.11 |
| `storage/sequence/libsequence.a` | 99,508 | 0.09 |
| `sql/libsql_sequence_embedded.a` | 95,722 | 0.09 |
| `mylite/libmylite.a` | 93,752 | 0.09 |

The largest individual objects are mostly SQL expression, type, parser,
charset, and optional type support:

| Object | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| `item_func.cc.o` | 1,575,832 |
| `sql_type.cc.o` | 1,456,224 |
| `item_strfunc.cc.o` | 1,440,840 |
| `yy_mariadb.cc.o` | 1,386,632 |
| `yy_oracle.cc.o` | 1,372,688 |
| `item.cc.o` | 1,258,392 |
| `item_create.cc.o` | 1,139,664 |
| `item_timefunc.cc.o` | 1,049,896 |
| `item_cmpfunc.cc.o` | 1,027,216 |
| `ctype-uca1400.c.o` | 973,408 |
| `item_geofunc.cc.o` | 908,920 |
| `field.cc.o` | 858,688 |
| `type_uuid/plugin.cc.o` | 858,584 |
| `type_inet/plugin.cc.o` | 794,384 |
| `type_inet/sql_type_inet.cc.o` | 749,712 |
| `ctype-uca.c.o` | 739,744 |

The current built-in plugins are:

- `binlog`
- `heap`
- `myisam` (hidden from user engine selection in the MyLite minsize profile)
- `mylite`
- `mysql_password`
- `sql_sequence`

| `query-cache-size-profile` after JSON schema | 36,101,680 | -7,303,752 | 8,390,256 | -10,941,648 | Passes current smokes and harness; query cache reports unavailable |
| Strip archive with `strip -g` | 42,261,216 | -1,144,216 | n/a | n/a | Low-risk packaging step |
| Strip archive with `strip --strip-unneeded` | 41,873,048 | -1,532,384 | n/a | n/a | Higher risk than `strip -g` for static archives |

| `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` | 34,474,690 | 0 from current | 15,849,720 | 0 from current | Reject; current smokes pass but no artifact-size reduction |

The two original `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` builds both completed and linked,
but `mylite-open-close-smoke --mode=exclusive` exited with signal 139. The
follow-up `charset-small-profile` slice fixed the UCA 1400 startup assumption
by skipping generated collations whose base compiled charset is absent. The
profile now passes current smokes while retaining the compiled default
`utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci`.

Stripping the current linked open-close smoke binary reduces it from
10,950,672 bytes
to 8,390,256 bytes, saving 2,560,416 bytes, or 2.44 MiB. That remains the
lowest-risk packaging win for any copied executable or shared-library style
artifact.

The LTO build reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by 1.25 MiB, but the
static archive became 326.61 MiB and GCC emitted type/ODR mismatch warnings
around MariaDB parser and server structures, including generated parser types.
That is not a safe release lever today.

The earlier plugin flags experiment did remove small built-ins such as `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, and `user_variables`, but `type_geom`, `type_inet`,
`type_uuid`, and `userstat` remained built in. The later type-plugin and
small-plugin profiles supersede that partial result.

The `type-plugin-size-profile` attempt then made `type_geom`, `type_inet`, and
`type_uuid` non-mandatory and disabled them in the MyLite minsize profile. That
reduced the static archive by 3,463,834 bytes and the stripped linked smoke by
396,104 bytes while current MyLite smokes still passed.

The `charset-small-profile` attempt then set `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` and
fixed UCA 1400 registration for omitted base charsets. On top of the type
plugin profile, it reduced the static archive by another 2,584,666 bytes and
the stripped linked smoke binary by another 2,495,240 bytes while current MyLite
smokes still passed.

The `oracle-parser-size-profile` attempt then removed `yy_oracle.cc.o` from the
embedded archive and linked a 1,664-byte unsupported-mode stub instead. On top
of the charset-small profile, it reduced the static archive by another
1,412,822 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 589,824 bytes
while current MyLite smokes still passed. The open/close smoke now verifies
that a statement parsed after `SET sql_mode=ORACLE` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

The `static-archive-strip-profile` attempt then ran `strip --strip-unneeded`
and `ranlib` on `libmariadbd.a` after building the `mysqlserver` target. On top
of the Oracle-parser profile, it reduced the static archive by another
1,337,440 bytes. The stripped linked smoke binary was unchanged, but relinking
current smokes against the stripped archive passed.

The `small-builtin-plugin-profile` attempt then disabled optional `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, `user_variables`, and `userstat` built-ins while leaving
mandatory `sql_sequence` support intact. On top of the static archive strip, it
reduced the static archive by another 131,980 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke binary by another 1,016 bytes.

The `xml-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_xmlfunc.cc` from the
embedded source list and removed the `EXTRACTVALUE` and `UPDATEXML` native
function builders in the minsize profile. On top of the small built-in plugin
profile, it reduced the static archive by another 517,000 bytes and the
stripped linked smoke binary by another 264,240 bytes. The linked open-close
smoke binary no longer contains `Item_func_xml_extractvalue`,
`Item_func_xml_update`, or `my_xpath_function` symbols, and the open/close
smoke verifies both XML functions now fail through MariaDB's unknown-function
path.

The `gis-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_geofunc.cc`,
`gcalc_tools.cc`, and `gcalc_slicescan.cc` from the embedded source list and
linked a small empty GIS registry/type-constructor shim instead. On top of the
XML function profile, it reduced the static archive by another 864,782 bytes
and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 463,440 bytes. The linked
open-close smoke binary no longer contains `Item_func_geometry_from_text`,
`Create_func_geometry_from_text`, or `Gcalc_function` symbols, and the
open/close smoke verifies `ST_ASTEXT()` now fails through MariaDB's
unknown-function path. The compatibility harness still verifies MyLite rejects
GEOMETRY columns and SPATIAL keys.

The `executable-export-size-profile` attempt then removed `ENABLE_EXPORTS TRUE`
from MyLite-owned smoke executables. On top of the GIS function profile, it left
the static archive unchanged and reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by
another 2,162,688 bytes. The dynamic symbol count in
`mylite-open-close-smoke` dropped from 28,646 to 488, and the link command no
longer includes `-Wl,--export-dynamic`. This is a linked-artifact size win, not
a static archive reduction.

The `vector-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_vectorfunc.cc`
and `vector_mhnsw.cc` from the embedded source list, guarded vector native
function builders, removed the mandatory `mhnsw` built-in plugin reference in
the vector-disabled profile, and linked a small MHNSW unsupported-symbol stub.
On top of the executable-export profile, it reduced the static archive by
another 230,182 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 1,152
bytes. The archive no longer defines `builtin_maria_mhnsw_plugin`,
`Item_func_vec_*`, `Create_func_vec_*`, `FVectorNode`, or `MHNSW_Share`
symbols, and the open/close smoke verifies `VEC_FROMTEXT()` and
`VEC_DISTANCE()` fail through MariaDB's unknown-function path.

The `profiling-size-profile` attempt then set `ENABLED_PROFILING=OFF` in the
minsize CMake profile and added a `SHOW PROFILES` disabled-feature smoke check.
On top of the vector-function profile, it reduced the static archive by another
166,334 bytes and left the stripped linked smoke binary unchanged. The archive
no longer defines the full `PROFILING`, `QUERY_PROFILE`, or
`PROF_MEASUREMENT` classes, while retaining small disabled-feature entry points
for MariaDB's existing SQL and information-schema wiring.

The `help-command-size-profile` attempt then removed `sql_help.cc` from the
embedded source list and linked a small unsupported-command shim for
`mysqld_help()` and `mysqld_help_prepare()`. On top of the profiling profile,
it reduced the static archive by another 183,200 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke binary by another 65,824 bytes. The archive now contains
`mylite_help_command_stub.cc.o` instead of the full help-table implementation,
and the open/close smoke verifies `HELP 'contents'` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

The `procedure-analyse-size-profile` attempt then removed `sql_analyse.cc` from
the embedded source list and linked a small unsupported-feature shim for
`proc_analyse_init()`. On top of the help-command profile, it reduced the
static archive by another 154,008 bytes and left the stripped linked smoke
binary unchanged. The archive now contains
`mylite_procedure_analyse_stub.cc.o` instead of the full result-set analyser,
and the open/close smoke verifies `SELECT ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

The `relr-linker-size-profile` attempt then installed `lld` in the minsize
container and linked executable, shared-library, and module artifacts with
`-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr`. On top
of the procedure-analyse profile, it left the static archive unchanged and
reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by another 4,072,080 bytes. The linked
smoke binary now contains `DT_RELR`, `DT_RELRSZ`, `DT_RELRENT`, and the
`GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR` version dependency. This is the largest linked-runtime
reduction so far, but it requires a modern glibc loader and should be treated
as a packaging baseline decision.

The `legacy-storage-engine-size-profile` attempt then removed CSV and
MRG_MyISAM from the MyLite minsize plugin list, kept MyISAM initialized for
MariaDB's inherited internal disk temporary table path, and marked MyISAM with
`HTON_NOT_USER_SELECTABLE` so explicit `ENGINE=MyISAM` DDL fails like an
unknown engine. On top of the RELR profile, it reduced the static archive by
another 252,074 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 33,440
bytes. The open/close smoke verifies `ENGINE=CSV`, `ENGINE=MyISAM`, and
`ENGINE=MRG_MyISAM` all fail through unknown-engine diagnostics, and the full
compatibility harness passes using `MEMORY` as the MariaDB reference engine.

The `section-gc-size-profile` attempt then revisited function/data sections
after the executable-export profile stopped exporting the full linked SQL
symbol set. On top of the legacy storage-engine profile, it grew the stripped
static `libmariadbd.a` by 4,413,456 bytes because every function/data section
adds object metadata, but it reduced the stripped linked open-close smoke by
328,176 bytes. The full compatibility harness still passes and the sidecar scan
still reports no unexpected sidecars. This is a linked-runtime-size lever, not
a static-archive-size lever.

The `json-schema-valid-size-profile` attempt then omitted the
`JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` native function builder and `json_schema.cc` from the
embedded source list while keeping ordinary JSON functions and
`json_schema_helper.cc` for retained JSON array-intersection code. On top of
the section-GC profile, it reduced the stripped static archive by another
345,732 bytes and the stripped linked open-close smoke by another 44,912 bytes.
The open/close smoke verifies `JSON_VALID()` still succeeds while
`JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` fails through MariaDB's unknown-function path. The full
compatibility harness passes and the sidecar scan reports no unexpected
sidecars.

The `query-cache-size-profile` attempt then removed `sql_cache.cc.o` and
`emb_qcache.cc.o` from the embedded minsize archive, linked a disabled
`Query_cache` shim, and set `have_query_cache=NO`. On top of the JSON-schema
profile, it reduced the static archive by 73,154 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke by 23,512 bytes while keeping normal `SELECT` execution and
`SELECT SQL_CACHE` syntax working as no-cache execution.

## Decision matrix

| Lever | Expected savings | Risk | Worth doing? | Reason |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Strip copied release binaries | About 2.48 MiB on the current linked smoke binary | Low | Yes | Standard packaging step; does not change source behavior |
| Strip release static archive with `strip --strip-unneeded` | 1.28 MiB beyond Oracle-parser profile | Medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes relink and pass; downstream static consumers may still need coverage |
| Strip release static archive with `strip -g` | About 0.95 MiB on the current archive | Low | Fallback | Less aggressive alternative if `--strip-unneeded` breaks a consumer |

| Remove or profile-gate Oracle SQL parser | 1.35 MiB archive and 0.56 MiB stripped linked beyond charset-small profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `sql_mode=ORACLE` now fails explicitly in the minsize profile |
| Remove XML SQL functions | 0.49 MiB archive and 0.25 MiB stripped linked beyond small-builtin profile | Medium compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `EXTRACTVALUE()` and `UPDATEXML()` now fail as unknown functions |

## Recommendations

Take these now:

1. Add an explicit release-packaging strip step for copied artifacts.
2. Keep `strip --strip-unneeded` for the minsize static archive while current
   consumer-link smokes pass.
3. Keep the lld RELR profile for aggressive modern-glibc package experiments,
   but re-measure without RELR before choosing a broad binary distribution
   baseline for older Linux targets.
4. Keep section GC for the most aggressive linked-runtime profile while the
   static archive growth remains an explicit tradeoff.
5. Keep the `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` omission in the minsize profile unless JSON
   Schema `CHECK` constraints become a compatibility target.
6. Keep the query-cache omission in the minsize profile. It is server-global
   cache state, reports unavailable through MariaDB's `have_query_cache`
   surface, and has low value in the embedded default.
7. Keep a stripped linked smoke binary size in the build report so regressions
   are visible.

Do not take these now:

1. Do not enable LTO for production. The linked binary gets smaller, but the
   archive becomes much larger and the compiler reports ODR-sensitive MariaDB
   type mismatches.
2. Do not spend time on `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=complex`, PSI switches, or section
   GC variants as standalone size work.

Research next if size becomes a release blocker:

1. Longer-term SQL-layer pruning of server-only surfaces. This is likely where
   meaningful multi-MiB savings exist, but it should be done as compatibility
   slices, not as broad dead-code removal.
2. Separate x86-64 size measurements for lld RELR before making architecture
   independent claims.

The best next decisions are deeper SQL-layer reductions as deliberate
compatibility work. Apart from RELR packing and section GC for linked runtime
artifacts, the current data does not support broad compiler/linker tuning as an
effective path.
