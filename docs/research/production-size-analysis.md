# Production size analysis

This document records the current production-oriented size profile for MyLite
and the measured impact of likely size-reduction levers.

## Measurement scope

The baseline is the current `tools/build-mariadb-minsize.sh` profile:

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel`
- `CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr -Wl,--gc-sections`
- `CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr -Wl,--gc-sections`
- `CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS=-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr -Wl,--gc-sections`
- `BUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release`
- `FEATURE_SET=small`
- `WITH_EMBEDDED_SERVER=ON`
- `DISABLE_SHARED=ON`
- `WITHOUT_DYNAMIC_PLUGINS=ON`
- system `ssl`, `pcre`, `fmt`, and `zlib`
- `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none`
- `DEFAULT_COLLATION=utf8mb4_general_ci`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_ORACLE_PARSER=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_ORACLE_FUNCTIONS=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_JSON_SCHEMA_VALID=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_QUERY_CACHE=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_SERVER_UTILITY_FUNCTIONS=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_UCA_COLLATIONS=ON`
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_LEGACY_STORAGE_ENGINES=ON`
- Aria, InnoDB, partitioning, Performance Schema, RocksDB, Mroonga, Connect,
  Spider, S3, OQGraph, Sphinx, ColumnStore, FederatedX, Blackhole, Archive,
  feedback, and selected authentication plugins disabled
- `MYLITE_DISABLE_ARIA=ON`
- `MYLITE_ENABLE_SECTION_GC=ON`
- `USE_ARIA_FOR_TMP_TABLES=OFF`

The original comparison baseline was generated at `2026-05-12T00:33:29Z` from
`vendor/mariadb/server` into `build/mariadb-minsize`. Current measurements
include the `type-plugin-size-profile`, `charset-small-profile`, and
`oracle-parser-size-profile`, `static-archive-strip-profile`, and
`small-builtin-plugin-profile`, `xml-function-size-profile`, and
`gis-function-size-profile`, `executable-export-size-profile`,
`vector-function-size-profile`, `profiling-size-profile`, and
`help-command-size-profile`, `procedure-analyse-size-profile`, and
`relr-linker-size-profile`, `legacy-storage-engine-size-profile`,
`section-gc-size-profile`, `json-schema-valid-size-profile`,
`query-cache-size-profile`, `oracle-function-size-profile`,
`server-utility-function-size-profile`, and `uca-collation-size-profile`
attempts, which remove the built-in
`type_geom`, `type_inet`, `type_uuid`, `sequence`, `thread_pool_info`,
`user_variables`, `userstat`, `mhnsw`, `csv`, and `myisammrg` plugins, set
`WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none`, omit the Oracle SQL-mode parser, omit XML, GIS, and
vector SQL functions, disable MariaDB statement profiling, omit the SQL `HELP`
command implementation, omit the `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` implementation, remove
full-symbol exports from MyLite smoke executables, link runtime-style artifacts
with lld and compact `DT_RELR` relative relocations, make the inherited MyISAM
engine non-user-selectable while retaining it for internal disk temporary
tables, compile minsize objects into per-function/per-data sections and link
runtime-style artifacts with `--gc-sections`, omit the `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()`
validator while retaining ordinary JSON functions, omit MariaDB's query cache
while reporting `have_query_cache=NO`, omit Oracle compatibility function
aliases and Oracle schema routing, omit server-utility SQL functions such as
`BENCHMARK()`, `GET_LOCK()`, `LOAD_FILE()`, replication wait helpers,
`SLEEP()`, and `UUID_SHORT()`, omit UCA 1400 and UCA 0900 collation support
while switching the aggressive minsize default collation to
`utf8mb4_general_ci`, and strip the static archive in the MyLite minsize
profile.

This project does not yet have a final packaged production artifact such as a
shared `libmylite.so` bundle. For now, the most useful size signals are:

- the static embedded MariaDB archive used by MyLite,
- the first-party MyLite wrapper archive,
- the MyLite engine component archive,
- stripped linked smoke binaries as an estimate of final linked footprint, and
- dynamic system libraries only if a distribution bundle chooses to vendor
  them instead of relying on platform packages.

## Current baseline

The current values were measured from a clean
`MYLITE_MARIADB_BUILD_DIR=build/mariadb-minsize-uca-collations` run.
Paths below use the default build directory names for readability.

| Artifact | Bytes | MiB | Notes |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/libmysqld/libmariadbd.a` | 33,777,694 | 32.21 | Main embedded MariaDB archive, 458 objects, stripped; section metadata grows the archive |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/mylite/libmylite.a` | 122,792 | 0.12 | First-party public wrapper |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/storage/mylite/libmylite_embedded.a` | 388,440 | 0.37 | MyLite storage-engine component archive |
| `build/mariadb-minsize/mylite/mylite-open-close-smoke` | 9,255,608 | 8.83 | Unstripped linked smoke binary, lld RELR and section GC |
| stripped `mylite-open-close-smoke` copy | 6,765,440 | 6.45 | `strip --strip-unneeded` on copied binary |

The linked smoke binary has this section profile:

| Section group | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| text | 5,303,000 |
| data | 1,459,056 |
| bss | 254,017 |
| total `size` decimal | 7,016,073 |

Largest linked sections in the open-close smoke binary:

| Section | Bytes | Interpretation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `.text` | 3,162,148 | Executable code |
| `.data.rel.ro` | 1,125,656 | Relocated read-only data |
| `.rodata` | 1,099,851 | Parser tables, SQL metadata, constants, retained Unicode data |
| `.eh_frame` | 720,336 | Unwind metadata |
| `.data` | 301,464 | Writable data |
| `.bss` | 251,961 | Zero-initialized writable data |
| `.eh_frame_hdr` | 164,252 | Unwind table index |
| `.rela.dyn` | 51,336 | Remaining unpacked dynamic relocations |
| `.relr.dyn` | 20,752 | Packed relative relocations |

If a Linux distribution bundle vendors the current dynamic dependencies, it
adds about 11,340,944 bytes, or 10.82 MiB, before compression:

| Dependency | Resolved file size |
| --- | ---: |
| `libpcre2-8.so.0.11.2` | 592,328 |
| `libz.so.1.3` | 133,272 |
| `libssl.so.3` | 737,192 |
| `libcrypto.so.3` | 4,597,928 |
| `libcrypt.so.1.1.0` | 198,584 |
| `libstdc++.so.6.0.33` | 2,633,224 |
| `libm.so.6` | 591,800 |
| `libgcc_s.so.1` | 133,696 |
| `libc.so.6` | 1,722,920 |

These libraries are not currently part of `libmariadbd.a`. They matter only for
distribution formats that bundle runtime libraries.

## Where the bytes are

The SQL layer dominates the current static footprint. The component table below
was captured before the type-plugin, charset-small, Oracle-parser, static
archive strip, and small-plugin size profiles were applied and explains why
those attempts were worth testing.

| Component archive | Bytes | MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `libmysqld/libsql_embedded.a` | 32,826,258 | 31.31 |
| `strings/libstrings.a` | 4,839,668 | 4.62 |
| `plugin/type_inet/libtype_inet_embedded.a` | 2,384,608 | 2.27 |
| `plugin/type_uuid/libtype_uuid_embedded.a` | 1,066,660 | 1.02 |
| `mysys/libmysys.a` | 649,718 | 0.62 |
| `storage/myisam/libmyisam_embedded.a` | 586,252 | 0.56 |
| `storage/mylite/libmylite_embedded.a` | 303,480 | 0.29 |
| `storage/heap/libheap_embedded.a` | 158,668 | 0.15 |
| `storage/myisammrg/libmyisammrg_embedded.a` | 152,748 | 0.15 |
| `storage/csv/libcsv.a` | 112,192 | 0.11 |
| `storage/sequence/libsequence.a` | 99,508 | 0.09 |
| `sql/libsql_sequence_embedded.a` | 95,722 | 0.09 |
| `mylite/libmylite.a` | 93,752 | 0.09 |

The largest individual objects are mostly SQL expression, type, parser,
charset, and optional type support:

| Object | Bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| `item_func.cc.o` | 1,575,832 |
| `sql_type.cc.o` | 1,456,224 |
| `item_strfunc.cc.o` | 1,440,840 |
| `yy_mariadb.cc.o` | 1,386,632 |
| `yy_oracle.cc.o` | 1,372,688 |
| `item.cc.o` | 1,258,392 |
| `item_create.cc.o` | 1,139,664 |
| `item_timefunc.cc.o` | 1,049,896 |
| `item_cmpfunc.cc.o` | 1,027,216 |
| `ctype-uca1400.c.o` | 973,408 |
| `item_geofunc.cc.o` | 908,920 |
| `field.cc.o` | 858,688 |
| `type_uuid/plugin.cc.o` | 858,584 |
| `type_inet/plugin.cc.o` | 794,384 |
| `type_inet/sql_type_inet.cc.o` | 749,712 |
| `ctype-uca.c.o` | 739,744 |

The current built-in plugins are:

- `binlog`
- `heap`
- `myisam` (hidden from user engine selection in the MyLite minsize profile)
- `mylite`
- `mysql_password`
- `sql_sequence`

| `uca-collation-size-profile` after server utilities | 33,777,694 | -9,627,738 | 6,765,440 | -12,566,464 | Passes current smokes and harness; UCA collations omitted and default collation is `utf8mb4_general_ci` |
| Strip archive with `strip -g` | 42,261,216 | -1,144,216 | n/a | n/a | Low-risk packaging step |
| Strip archive with `strip --strip-unneeded` | 41,873,048 | -1,532,384 | n/a | n/a | Higher risk than `strip -g` for static archives |
| `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` before UCA fix | 40,820,782 | -2,584,650 | 16,836,664 | -2,495,240 | Segfaulted in open-close smoke |
| `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none`, `DEFAULT_COLLATION=utf8mb4_general_ci`, before UCA fix | 40,820,774 | -2,584,658 | 16,836,664 | -2,495,240 | Still segfaulted in open-close smoke |

| `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` | 34,474,690 | 0 from current | 15,849,720 | 0 from current | Reject; current smokes pass but no artifact-size reduction |
| early `-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections` plus `--gc-sections` before export removal | 48,305,352 | +4,899,920 | 19,331,816 | -88 | Superseded by `section-gc-size-profile` after executable exports were removed |
| CMake LTO | 342,480,510 | +299,075,078 | 18,016,192 | -1,315,712 | Reject for now due archive bloat and ODR warnings |

The two original `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` builds both completed and linked,
but `mylite-open-close-smoke --mode=exclusive` exited with signal 139. The
follow-up `charset-small-profile` slice fixed the UCA 1400 startup assumption
by skipping generated collations whose base compiled charset is absent. The
profile now passes current smokes while retaining the compiled default
`utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci`.

Stripping the current linked open-close smoke binary reduces it from
9,255,608 bytes to 6,765,440 bytes, saving 2,490,168 bytes, or 2.37 MiB.
That remains the
lowest-risk packaging win for any copied executable or shared-library style
artifact.

The LTO build reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by 1.25 MiB, but the
static archive became 326.61 MiB and GCC emitted type/ODR mismatch warnings
around MariaDB parser and server structures, including generated parser types.
That is not a safe release lever today.

The earlier plugin flags experiment did remove small built-ins such as `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, and `user_variables`, but `type_geom`, `type_inet`,
`type_uuid`, and `userstat` remained built in. The later type-plugin and
small-plugin profiles supersede that partial result.

The `type-plugin-size-profile` attempt then made `type_geom`, `type_inet`, and
`type_uuid` non-mandatory and disabled them in the MyLite minsize profile. That
reduced the static archive by 3,463,834 bytes and the stripped linked smoke by
396,104 bytes while current MyLite smokes still passed.

The `charset-small-profile` attempt then set `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` and
fixed UCA 1400 registration for omitted base charsets. On top of the type
plugin profile, it reduced the static archive by another 2,584,666 bytes and
the stripped linked smoke binary by another 2,495,240 bytes while current MyLite
smokes still passed.

The `oracle-parser-size-profile` attempt then removed `yy_oracle.cc.o` from the
embedded archive and linked a 1,664-byte unsupported-mode stub instead. On top
of the charset-small profile, it reduced the static archive by another
1,412,822 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 589,824 bytes
while current MyLite smokes still passed. The open/close smoke now verifies
that a statement parsed after `SET sql_mode=ORACLE` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

The `static-archive-strip-profile` attempt then ran `strip --strip-unneeded`
and `ranlib` on `libmariadbd.a` after building the `mysqlserver` target. On top
of the Oracle-parser profile, it reduced the static archive by another
1,337,440 bytes. The stripped linked smoke binary was unchanged, but relinking
current smokes against the stripped archive passed.

The `small-builtin-plugin-profile` attempt then disabled optional `sequence`,
`thread_pool_info`, `user_variables`, and `userstat` built-ins while leaving
mandatory `sql_sequence` support intact. On top of the static archive strip, it
reduced the static archive by another 131,980 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke binary by another 1,016 bytes.

The `xml-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_xmlfunc.cc` from the
embedded source list and removed the `EXTRACTVALUE` and `UPDATEXML` native
function builders in the minsize profile. On top of the small built-in plugin
profile, it reduced the static archive by another 517,000 bytes and the
stripped linked smoke binary by another 264,240 bytes. The linked open-close
smoke binary no longer contains `Item_func_xml_extractvalue`,
`Item_func_xml_update`, or `my_xpath_function` symbols, and the open/close
smoke verifies both XML functions now fail through MariaDB's unknown-function
path.

The `gis-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_geofunc.cc`,
`gcalc_tools.cc`, and `gcalc_slicescan.cc` from the embedded source list and
linked a small empty GIS registry/type-constructor shim instead. On top of the
XML function profile, it reduced the static archive by another 864,782 bytes
and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 463,440 bytes. The linked
open-close smoke binary no longer contains `Item_func_geometry_from_text`,
`Create_func_geometry_from_text`, or `Gcalc_function` symbols, and the
open/close smoke verifies `ST_ASTEXT()` now fails through MariaDB's
unknown-function path. The compatibility harness still verifies MyLite rejects
GEOMETRY columns and SPATIAL keys.

The `executable-export-size-profile` attempt then removed `ENABLE_EXPORTS TRUE`
from MyLite-owned smoke executables. On top of the GIS function profile, it left
the static archive unchanged and reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by
another 2,162,688 bytes. The dynamic symbol count in
`mylite-open-close-smoke` dropped from 28,646 to 488, and the link command no
longer includes `-Wl,--export-dynamic`. This is a linked-artifact size win, not
a static archive reduction.

The `vector-function-size-profile` attempt then omitted `item_vectorfunc.cc`
and `vector_mhnsw.cc` from the embedded source list, guarded vector native
function builders, removed the mandatory `mhnsw` built-in plugin reference in
the vector-disabled profile, and linked a small MHNSW unsupported-symbol stub.
On top of the executable-export profile, it reduced the static archive by
another 230,182 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 1,152
bytes. The archive no longer defines `builtin_maria_mhnsw_plugin`,
`Item_func_vec_*`, `Create_func_vec_*`, `FVectorNode`, or `MHNSW_Share`
symbols, and the open/close smoke verifies `VEC_FROMTEXT()` and
`VEC_DISTANCE()` fail through MariaDB's unknown-function path.

The `profiling-size-profile` attempt then set `ENABLED_PROFILING=OFF` in the
minsize CMake profile and added a `SHOW PROFILES` disabled-feature smoke check.
On top of the vector-function profile, it reduced the static archive by another
166,334 bytes and left the stripped linked smoke binary unchanged. The archive
no longer defines the full `PROFILING`, `QUERY_PROFILE`, or
`PROF_MEASUREMENT` classes, while retaining small disabled-feature entry points
for MariaDB's existing SQL and information-schema wiring.

The `help-command-size-profile` attempt then removed `sql_help.cc` from the
embedded source list and linked a small unsupported-command shim for
`mysqld_help()` and `mysqld_help_prepare()`. On top of the profiling profile,
it reduced the static archive by another 183,200 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke binary by another 65,824 bytes. The archive now contains
`mylite_help_command_stub.cc.o` instead of the full help-table implementation,
and the open/close smoke verifies `HELP 'contents'` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

The `procedure-analyse-size-profile` attempt then removed `sql_analyse.cc` from
the embedded source list and linked a small unsupported-feature shim for
`proc_analyse_init()`. On top of the help-command profile, it reduced the
static archive by another 154,008 bytes and left the stripped linked smoke
binary unchanged. The archive now contains
`mylite_procedure_analyse_stub.cc.o` instead of the full result-set analyser,
and the open/close smoke verifies `SELECT ... PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` fails with
`ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_YET`.

The `relr-linker-size-profile` attempt then installed `lld` in the minsize
container and linked executable, shared-library, and module artifacts with
`-fuse-ld=lld -Wl,-z,pack-relative-relocs -Wl,--pack-dyn-relocs=relr`. On top
of the procedure-analyse profile, it left the static archive unchanged and
reduced the stripped linked smoke binary by another 4,072,080 bytes. The linked
smoke binary now contains `DT_RELR`, `DT_RELRSZ`, `DT_RELRENT`, and the
`GLIBC_ABI_DT_RELR` version dependency. This is the largest linked-runtime
reduction so far, but it requires a modern glibc loader and should be treated
as a packaging baseline decision.

The `legacy-storage-engine-size-profile` attempt then removed CSV and
MRG_MyISAM from the MyLite minsize plugin list, kept MyISAM initialized for
MariaDB's inherited internal disk temporary table path, and marked MyISAM with
`HTON_NOT_USER_SELECTABLE` so explicit `ENGINE=MyISAM` DDL fails like an
unknown engine. On top of the RELR profile, it reduced the static archive by
another 252,074 bytes and the stripped linked smoke binary by another 33,440
bytes. The open/close smoke verifies `ENGINE=CSV`, `ENGINE=MyISAM`, and
`ENGINE=MRG_MyISAM` all fail through unknown-engine diagnostics, and the full
compatibility harness passes using `MEMORY` as the MariaDB reference engine.

The `section-gc-size-profile` attempt then revisited function/data sections
after the executable-export profile stopped exporting the full linked SQL
symbol set. On top of the legacy storage-engine profile, it grew the stripped
static `libmariadbd.a` by 4,413,456 bytes because every function/data section
adds object metadata, but it reduced the stripped linked open-close smoke by
328,176 bytes. The full compatibility harness still passes and the sidecar scan
still reports no unexpected sidecars. This is a linked-runtime-size lever, not
a static-archive-size lever.

The `json-schema-valid-size-profile` attempt then omitted the
`JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` native function builder and `json_schema.cc` from the
embedded source list while keeping ordinary JSON functions and
`json_schema_helper.cc` for retained JSON array-intersection code. On top of
the section-GC profile, it reduced the stripped static archive by another
345,732 bytes and the stripped linked open-close smoke by another 44,912 bytes.
The open/close smoke verifies `JSON_VALID()` still succeeds while
`JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` fails through MariaDB's unknown-function path. The full
compatibility harness passes and the sidecar scan reports no unexpected
sidecars.

The `query-cache-size-profile` attempt then removed `sql_cache.cc.o` and
`emb_qcache.cc.o` from the embedded minsize archive, linked a disabled
`Query_cache` shim, and set `have_query_cache=NO`. On top of the JSON-schema
profile, it reduced the static archive by 73,154 bytes and the stripped linked
smoke by 23,512 bytes while keeping normal `SELECT` execution and
`SELECT SQL_CACHE` syntax working as no-cache execution.

The `oracle-function-size-profile` attempt then removed Oracle compatibility
function aliases and the Oracle native function hash from the embedded minsize
profile, routed parser-side Oracle-only constructs to unsupported diagnostics,
and stopped registering `oracle_schema` as a distinct built-in schema. On top
of the query-cache profile, it reduced the static archive by 318,034 bytes and
the stripped linked smoke by 34,376 bytes. The linked smoke binary no longer
contains Oracle-specific item vtables or native function builders; the
remaining Oracle-named linked symbols are `oracle_schema_ref` and the inherited
`Date_time_format_oracle` helper.

The `server-utility-function-size-profile` attempt then removed native builders
and item class implementations for `BENCHMARK()`, `BINLOG_GTID_POS()`,
`GET_LOCK()`, `IS_FREE_LOCK()`, `IS_USED_LOCK()`, `LOAD_FILE()`,
`MASTER_GTID_WAIT()`, `MASTER_POS_WAIT()`, `RELEASE_ALL_LOCKS()`,
`RELEASE_LOCK()`, `SLEEP()`, and `UUID_SHORT()` in the aggressive minsize
profile. Shared lifecycle helpers such as user-level-lock cleanup,
`pause_execution()`, and `server_uuid_value()` remain because other retained
MariaDB code still references them. On top of the Oracle-function profile, it
reduced the static archive by 228,044 bytes and the stripped linked smoke by
37,576 bytes. The open/close smoke verifies each removed function fails as an
unknown function and retained functions such as `RANDOM_BYTES()`, `VERSION()`,
and `CONNECTION_ID()` still execute.

The `uca-collation-size-profile` attempt then made `HAVE_UCA_COLLATIONS`
optional for the aggressive minsize profile, stopped compiling the UCA 0900
alias object and UCA 1400 generated data object, retained a tiny no-UCA
`ctype-uca.c.o` for shared contraction helper symbols, disabled MariaDB's
startup remap of Unicode character-set defaults to `uca1400_ai_ci`, and set
the compiled default collation to `utf8mb4_general_ci`. On top of the
server-utility profile, it reduced the static archive by 1,777,908 bytes and
the stripped linked smoke by 1,552,864 bytes. The open/close smoke verifies
`@@collation_server=utf8mb4_general_ci`, verifies explicit
`utf8mb4_general_ci` use succeeds, and verifies `utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci` fails
with MariaDB's unknown-collation diagnostic.

## Decision matrix

| Lever | Expected savings | Risk | Worth doing? | Reason |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| Strip copied release binaries | About 2.37 MiB on the current linked smoke binary | Low | Yes | Standard packaging step; does not change source behavior |
| Strip release static archive with `strip --strip-unneeded` | 1.28 MiB beyond Oracle-parser profile | Medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes relink and pass; downstream static consumers may still need coverage |
| Strip release static archive with `strip -g` | About 0.95 MiB on the current archive | Low | Fallback | Less aggressive alternative if `--strip-unneeded` breaks a consumer |
| `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=complex` | About 0.08 MiB | Low | No | Savings are too small to justify a compatibility profile |
| `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=none` / `charset-small-profile` | 2.46 MiB archive and 2.38 MiB stripped linked beyond type-plugin profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass after the UCA 1400 null-base fix, but non-default charsets are omitted |
| Make type plugins profile-gated | 3.30 MiB archive, 0.38 MiB stripped linked | Medium/high | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `INET`, `UUID`, and spatial plugin surfaces are compatibility tradeoffs |
| Remove small optional built-ins | 0.13 MiB archive, 0.001 MiB stripped linked | Medium/low | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but plugin-provided information-schema surfaces are omitted |
| Remove or profile-gate Oracle SQL parser | 1.35 MiB archive and 0.56 MiB stripped linked beyond charset-small profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `sql_mode=ORACLE` now fails explicitly in the minsize profile |
| Remove XML SQL functions | 0.49 MiB archive and 0.25 MiB stripped linked beyond small-builtin profile | Medium compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but `EXTRACTVALUE()` and `UPDATEXML()` now fail as unknown functions |
| Remove GIS SQL functions | 0.82 MiB archive and 0.44 MiB stripped linked beyond XML profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but native GIS functions now fail as unknown functions in the minsize profile |
| Remove unnecessary executable symbol exports | 0 archive, 2.06 MiB stripped linked beyond GIS profile | Low/medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; this only applies to linked executables that are not dynamic-plugin hosts |
| Remove vector SQL functions and MHNSW | 0.22 MiB archive, negligible stripped linked beyond executable-export profile | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass, but vector functions and MHNSW vector indexes are omitted from the minsize profile |
| Disable statement profiling | 0.16 MiB archive, no stripped linked change beyond vector-function profile | Low/medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; `SHOW PROFILE(S)` now report MariaDB's disabled-feature diagnostic |
| Remove SQL `HELP` command implementation | 0.17 MiB archive, 0.06 MiB stripped linked beyond profiling profile | Low/medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; `HELP` now reports a stable unsupported-command diagnostic |
| Remove `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` implementation | 0.15 MiB archive, no stripped linked change beyond HELP profile | Low/medium | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; `PROCEDURE ANALYSE()` now reports a stable unsupported-feature diagnostic |
| Link runtime artifacts with lld RELR | 0 archive, 3.88 MiB stripped linked beyond procedure-analyse profile | Medium packaging | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; artifacts require modern glibc `DT_RELR` support |
| Hide legacy durable storage engines | 0.24 MiB archive, 0.03 MiB stripped linked beyond RELR | Medium compatibility | Applied as size attempt | CSV/MRG are omitted; MyISAM stays internal for disk temp tables but user `ENGINE=MyISAM` is rejected |
| Section garbage collection after executable-export removal | +4.21 MiB archive, 0.31 MiB stripped linked beyond legacy engines | Medium packaging | Applied as aggressive linked-size attempt | Runtime gets smaller, but archive consumers pay a metadata cost |
| Remove `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` validator | 0.33 MiB archive, 0.04 MiB stripped linked beyond section GC | Medium compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; ordinary JSON functions remain, but JSON Schema validation is omitted from the minsize profile |
| Remove query cache | 0.07 MiB archive, 0.02 MiB stripped linked beyond JSON schema | Low/medium compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; query cache reports unavailable and `SELECT SQL_CACHE` executes without caching |
| Remove Oracle compatibility aliases | 0.30 MiB archive, 0.03 MiB stripped linked beyond query cache | High compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; `SQL_MODE=ORACLE` was already unsupported, and Oracle-only aliases now fail as unknown functions |
| Remove server utility SQL functions | 0.22 MiB archive, 0.04 MiB stripped linked beyond Oracle aliases | Medium compatibility | Applied as size attempt | Current smokes pass; daemon, replication, file-host, lock, benchmark, and delay helpers now fail as unknown functions |
| Remove UCA collations and use `utf8mb4_general_ci` | 1.70 MiB archive, 1.48 MiB stripped linked beyond server utilities | High compatibility | Applied as aggressive size attempt | Current smokes pass, but MariaDB 11.8's default UCA 1400 collation and MySQL 8.0 UCA 0900 aliases are omitted |
| Remove server-only SQL subsystems | Potentially large | High | Research later | The big bytes are entangled in `libsql_embedded.a`; needs slice-by-slice fork work |
| `DISABLE_PSI_*` switches | 0 in this build | Low | No | No measured effect |
| `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` | 0 in this build | Low | No | Full rebuild produced identical archive and stripped linked sizes |
| LTO | About 1.25 MiB linked, archive much larger | High | No | ODR warnings and huge archives are unacceptable for release |
| Bundle fewer dynamic libraries | Up to 10.82 MiB if currently vendored | Distribution-dependent | Decide per packaging target | Current static archive does not include these libraries |

## Recommendations

Take these now:

1. Add an explicit release-packaging strip step for copied artifacts.
2. Keep `strip --strip-unneeded` for the minsize static archive while current
   consumer-link smokes pass.
3. Keep the lld RELR profile for aggressive modern-glibc package experiments,
   but re-measure without RELR before choosing a broad binary distribution
   baseline for older Linux targets.
4. Keep section GC for the most aggressive linked-runtime profile while the
   static archive growth remains an explicit tradeoff.
5. Keep the `JSON_SCHEMA_VALID()` omission in the minsize profile unless JSON
   Schema `CHECK` constraints become a compatibility target.
6. Keep the query-cache omission in the minsize profile. It is server-global
   cache state, reports unavailable through MariaDB's `have_query_cache`
   surface, and has low value in the embedded default.
7. Keep the Oracle compatibility alias omission in the aggressive minsize
   profile if MyLite's default does not target Oracle migration workloads.
   It now follows the already-applied Oracle parser removal.
8. Keep the server-utility function omission in the aggressive minsize profile.
   These functions expose daemon, replication, host-file, benchmark, and
   deliberate-delay behavior with low value in MyLite's embedded default.
9. Keep the UCA-collation omission only for the most aggressive size profile
   unless product compatibility explicitly accepts `utf8mb4_general_ci` instead
   of MariaDB 11.8's `utf8mb4_uca1400_ai_ci` default.
10. Keep a stripped linked smoke binary size in the build report so regressions
   are visible.

Do not take these now:

1. Do not enable LTO for production. The linked binary gets smaller, but the
   archive becomes much larger and the compiler reports ODR-sensitive MariaDB
   type mismatches.
2. Do not spend time on `WITH_EXTRA_CHARSETS=complex`, PSI switches, or section
   GC variants as standalone size work.

Research next if size becomes a release blocker:

1. Investigate retained Unicode casefold tables and `general1400` collations.
   The current UCA-free linked binary still contains `my_u1400_casefold_index`
   and `my_u1400tr_casefold_index`, but removing them is another collation
   compatibility decision.
2. Longer-term SQL-layer pruning of server-only surfaces. This is likely where
   meaningful multi-MiB savings exist, but it should be done as compatibility
   slices, not as broad dead-code removal.
3. Separate x86-64 size measurements for lld RELR before making architecture
   independent claims.

The best next decisions are deeper SQL-layer reductions as deliberate
compatibility work. Apart from RELR packing and section GC for linked runtime
artifacts, the current data does not support broad compiler/linker tuning as an
effective path.
