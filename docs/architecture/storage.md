# Storage Architecture

MyLite storage is a purpose-built MariaDB storage engine backed by one primary
`.mylite` file. MariaDB provides SQL parsing, metadata semantics, optimizer
integration, expression evaluation, diagnostics, and handler calls; MyLite owns
durable catalog, row, index, transaction, lock, and recovery state.

## Product Invariant

"Single file" means one primary database asset, not "no other file is ever
created while the database is open."

- The portable durable asset is one file, such as `app.mylite`.
- Persistent MariaDB sidecars are not valid MyLite storage: no `.frm`, `.ibd`,
  `.MYD`, `.MYI`, `.MAI`, `.MAD`, `aria_log.*`, `ib_logfile*`, binlog, relay
  log, or plugin-owned durable table files.
- MyLite-owned rollback journal, WAL, shared-memory, lock, and temporary spill
  files are allowed when their names, recovery behavior, cleanup behavior, and
  failure modes are documented and tested.
- Recovery companions left after an unclean shutdown are part of the MyLite
  lifecycle, not separate user-managed database assets.

This is stricter than a datadir-in-a-directory model and more practical than a
rule that forbids recovery or temporary companions.

## Architecture Decision

MyLite uses a new static storage engine. It does not wrap an ordinary MariaDB
datadir inside a container file, and it does not put SQLite SQL execution below
MariaDB SQL execution.

Reasons:

- MariaDB's handler API is the correct boundary for preserving MariaDB SQL
  semantics while replacing durable storage.
- Existing InnoDB, MyISAM, and Aria durable files conflict with the portable
  primary-file model.
- A virtual datadir keeps MariaDB's file, log, lock, and recovery systems
  nested inside another filesystem layer; that is harder to make durable and
  smaller than a direct storage engine.
- SQLite is useful as design evidence for file ownership and pager tradeoffs,
  but SQLite SQL semantics do not match MariaDB semantics.

## Implementation Boundary

Durable MyLite storage lives in the internal first-party
`packages/mylite-storage/` target. MariaDB-facing handler glue lives under
`mariadb/storage/mylite/` and should stay as thin as practical: translate
MariaDB handler calls into MyLite storage operations, return MariaDB handler
errors, and preserve upstream registration conventions.

This split keeps catalog, page, transaction, lock, and recovery code outside the
MariaDB import while limiting the long-lived fork delta under `mariadb/`.

The initial handler is opt-in. It is disabled in the default embedded baseline
and covered by a separate storage smoke build. That build verifies the
`MYLITE` row from `SHOW ENGINES`, explicit `CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE=MYLITE`
stores metadata in the primary `.mylite` catalog, and catalog discovery works
after close/reopen. Keyless routed tables support row inserts and full scans
from the primary file. `DROP TABLE` removes catalog metadata for routed tables.
Simple `RENAME TABLE` updates catalog identity while preserving table ids and
row pages. The narrow single-column autoincrement key path is supported for
insert and full-scan workloads. General keyed writes, indexes, update/delete,
and `ALTER` still reject until later slices define those update paths.

## File Layout

The `.mylite` file format should be page based:

```text
header
catalog pages
table row pages
index pages
transaction metadata
free-space metadata
integrity and checkpoint metadata
```

The header stores:

- magic bytes,
- file-format version,
- MyLite library compatibility version,
- page size,
- endian marker,
- checksum mode,
- catalog root page,
- transaction/checkpoint pointers,
- durability and feature flags.

The current implementation writes page 0 as a fixed-size, little-endian,
checksummed header and page 1 as a catalog root. Explicit MyLite table
definitions are stored as catalog records plus checksummed definition blob
pages. Keyless row inserts append checksummed row pages that store raw MariaDB
record images tagged by catalog table id; table scans validate those pages and
copy matching records back into MariaDB's row buffers. Autoincrement tables
append checksummed state pages keyed by catalog table id so generated values
survive close/reopen and dropped table ids do not leak into recreated tables.
Indexes and transaction state are still planned slices.

The catalog stores:

- schemas,
- table definitions,
- table-definition binary images needed by MariaDB discovery,
- columns, indexes, constraints, and engine metadata,
- views, triggers, and routines when those surfaces are supported,
- collation and character-set metadata needed to reopen tables,
- autoincrement state,
- table and index root pages.

## Table Definitions

The first metadata bridge stores MariaDB-produced table-definition images in
the MyLite catalog. MariaDB's table-discovery API can initialize a
`TABLE_SHARE` from a binary `.frm` image or from a SQL statement string; the
binary image is the lower-risk first bridge because it preserves the exact
definition MariaDB produced.

DDL routing must cover both discovery and writes:

1. Let MariaDB build the canonical table definition during `CREATE` or `ALTER`.
2. Store the generated definition and MyLite metadata in the catalog.
3. Suppress durable `.frm` creation for MyLite tables.
4. Implement `discover_table()`, `discover_table_names()`, and
   `discover_table_existence()` from the catalog.
5. Use catalog table-definition versions to detect stale cached definitions and
   report `HA_ERR_TABLE_DEF_CHANGED` when required.

`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, and `RENAME` are the minimum DDL lifecycle for
claiming native single-file table metadata.

Current support covers metadata capture and discovery for omitted/default
engine requests, explicit `ENGINE=MYLITE`, and metadata-safe `ENGINE=InnoDB`,
`ENGINE=MyISAM`, and `ENGINE=Aria` requests. The catalog records both the
requested engine name and the effective `MYLITE` engine. Unsupported explicit
engine requests fail before catalog publication. `DROP TABLE` removes the live
catalog record and increments the catalog generation without deleting external
MariaDB sidecars. Dropped table-definition blobs and row pages remain orphaned
inside the primary file until free-space management exists; new table ids are
allocated above both live catalog records and existing row pages so
drop/recreate does not expose old rows. Simple `RENAME TABLE` rewrites the
catalog record identity while preserving table id, requested/effective engine
metadata, and the stored table-definition blob reference, so existing keyless
row pages move with the renamed table. Index rename paths remain planned until
MyLite owns index storage.

## Schemas And System Surfaces

MariaDB's `database.table` model maps to catalog namespaces:

```text
schema_id -> schema name
table_id  -> schema_id + table name
index_id  -> table_id + index name
```

No persistent directory is created for a schema. `CREATE DATABASE`,
`DROP DATABASE`, `USE`, table-name resolution, and information schema listing
read catalog namespaces.

The default embedded profile does not expose server account administration,
dynamic plugin installation, replication metadata, or the event scheduler.
`information_schema` remains virtual. Any required `mysql.*` system surface
must be implemented as MyLite-backed metadata or a read-only virtual surface,
not as Aria tables in a datadir.

## Rows And Indexes

Rows and indexes live in MyLite pages, not in MariaDB engine files. The first
row format should preserve enough MariaDB record layout information to avoid
inventing a parallel SQL type system. Over time, the storage format can move
toward typed native encodings when there is a compatibility and size benefit.

Current row support is intentionally narrow. For tables without declared keys
or autoincrement columns, `write_row()` stores MariaDB's record image in an
append-only row page and `rnd_next()` reads those images back during full table
scans. Nullable fixed and variable fields are covered for this keyless non-BLOB
path because the stored record image includes MariaDB's null bitmap. Tables
whose only key is the single `AUTO_INCREMENT` column can also insert and scan
non-BLOB rows; MyLite stores the durable next value in append-only state pages
and performs a scan-based duplicate check for that narrow key shape. Other
keyed writes still reject, because MyLite cannot claim MySQL/MariaDB
duplicate-key, ordering, or index-access behavior until the index slice
implements it. Update, delete, truncate, BLOB/TEXT overflow, and copy `ALTER`
rebuilds remain planned.

The storage engine must support:

- table scans,
- primary, unique, and secondary indexes,
- ordered index reads,
- duplicate-key checks,
- nullable-key semantics,
- BLOB/TEXT overflow storage,
- autoincrement state,
- row insert/update/delete,
- truncate,
- table rebuilds for copy `ALTER`.

FULLTEXT, SPATIAL, generated-column indexes, and foreign-key enforcement need
explicit storage designs before support is claimed.

## Transactions And Recovery

MyLite needs its own transaction and recovery layer. It must not rely on
InnoDB, Aria, binlog, or server datadir recovery as durable application state.

Minimum guarantees:

- atomic publication of catalog, row, and index changes,
- rollback for failed statements and transactions,
- crash recovery after process or OS crash,
- corruption detection for critical pages,
- deterministic recovery and cleanup for any MyLite-owned journal or WAL
  companions,
- file locking that prevents unsafe concurrent writers.

The storage design must preserve the full write-concurrency goal. Early
milestones may use coarse locks for correctness, but the page, transaction,
and lock manager designs must not bake in single-writer-only assumptions.

## Temporary Data

Temporary tables, query spill files, and recovery companions are storage policy,
not violations of the primary-file model.

- User temporary tables start as session-local state and do not publish durable
  catalog entries.
- Internal temporary spill may use MyLite-owned temporary files.
- Strict no-temp-file modes may exist, but they trade off query limits and
  performance.
- Companion files must use deterministic names tied to the primary file and
  must be covered by lifecycle tests.

## Migration

MyLite does not open arbitrary MariaDB datadirs as `.mylite` files. Migration is
logical first:

- import SQL dumps,
- export MariaDB-compatible SQL dumps where practical,
- add stopped-datadir import tooling only after the storage engine is stable.
